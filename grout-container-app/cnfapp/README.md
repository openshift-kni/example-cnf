# cnfapp

Container image that allows you to configure Grout in a container and prepare it to launch it.

## What is it executed?

This container runs `/usr/local/bin/example-cnf/grout-wrapper`. [This script](scripts/grout-wrapper) starts running `grout` in background mode, and then it retrieves context information to build the command to run `grcli` command-line tool to inject all the network configuration that is required for the tests.

When calling to `grout` service, the following logs are printed, showing you that it already takes some EAL parameters from the running execution context:

```
NOTICE: GROUT: main: starting grout version v0.9.1-0-g755f158c
NOTICE: GROUT: main: License available at https://git.dpdk.org/apps/grout/plain/LICENSE

INFO: GROUT: api_socket_start: listening on API socket grout.sock
```

This creates an abstract API socket, `grout.sock`, that allows us to interact with Grout through CLI, but not requiring to maintain an interactive session to make it work, like it happened with TestPMD.

The config file to be used to inject the network information is saved under `/usr/local/bin/example-cnf/run/grout.init`, and it includes:

- The PCI addresses to be used for each interface. The MAC addresses are automatically injected by Grout once you create the interface.
- The IP address to be used per interface. These are retrieved by [this script](scripts/retrieve-grout-ip-addresses), which is placed on `/usr/local/bin/example-cnf/retrieve-grout-ip-addresses`

This is an example of what we could find in that config file:

```
sh-4.4$ cat /usr/local/bin/example-cnf/run/grout.init
add interface port p0 devargs 0000:86:02.1 rxqs 2
add interface port p1 devargs 0000:86:03.3 rxqs 2

add ip address 172.16.16.60/24 iface p0
add ip address 172.16.21.60/24 iface p1
```

The file created by the automation to launch the Grout configuration is saved under `/usr/local/bin/example-cnf/run/config-grout`, and it has the following content:

```
sh-4.4$ cat config-grout
grcli -f /usr/local/bin/example-cnf/run/grout.init 2>&1 | tee /var/log/grout/app.log
```

To deploy that config, we use the `grcli` command. If using `-f` argument, we will run all the commands that are defined in the file. If just using `grcli`, we'll open a CLI session with Grout and we can start interacting with the service. And also, we can use `grcli` followed by a Grout command to perform a particular action.

For example, we can print statistics in the following way:

```
# clear statistics
$ sudo grcli clear stats

# print statistics
$ sudo grcli show stats software

Also, you can trace the traffic received by Grout with the following configuration.

> Note trace should not be used during performance testing, since it impacts performance. Just use it for troubleshooting purposes.


```
# enter in grout CLI
$ grcli
grout# set trace all

# if you get the latest N traces of traffic managed by Grout, you
# will be able to see traffic details.
grout# show trace count 50

## What to update if bumping container version

Apart from the modifications you have to do, you also need to update the container version in these files:

- [Dockerfile](Dockerfile).
- [build.sh](../build.sh) (from parent folder).
- [Makefile](../Makefile) (from parent folder).

Here's an [example](https://github.com/openshift-kni/example-cnf/pull/111) where this is done.
